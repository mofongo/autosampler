This is my first attempt at writing a Norns script. I'm mostly focused on learning to use [Softcut](https://monome.org/docs/norns/softcut/) and getting familiar with the Lua scripting launguage. The script uses a poll to track the volume of the incoming audio and records to a softcut buffer whenever the input audio passes a specified threshold. 

There are no visuals yet.
