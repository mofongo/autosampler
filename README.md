This is my first attempt at writing a Norns script. I'm mostly focused on learning how to use Softcut|https://monome.org/docs/norns/softcut/ and Lua. The script uses a poll to track the volume of the incoming audio and records to a softcut buffer whenever the input audio passes a specified threshold. 

There no visuals yet.
